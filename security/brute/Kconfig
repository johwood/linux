	  This is an LSM that stops any fork brute force attack against
	  vulnerable userspace processes. The detection method is based on
	  the application crash period and as a mitigation procedure all the
	  offending tasks are killed. Like capabilities, this security module
	  stacks with other LSMs. Further information can be found in
	  Documentation/admin-guide/LSM/Brute.rst.

	  If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer N.
